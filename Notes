It has been a severe beat down trying to get things to work correctly with
go modules.  I will attempt to document here what I think works and,
hopefully, this will continue to be true going forward.

1. Work outside of the GOPATH.  In my case, I am in ~/Programming/go/shippy.
   I cloned my github project to create this shippy folder.
   I also deleted the src/github.com/RichJames/shippy folder.  I want only
   one project source directory on my local drive.
2. Do NOT create go.mod and go.sum inside the shippy parent folder.
3. Create go.mod inside each of consignment-server, consignment-cli,
   vessel-server, user-server, user-cli folders.  This makes each of
   those pieces a module in go mod's eyes.  To create the first go.mod
   file, run go mod init github.com/RichJames/shippy/<foldername>.
4. Then run go build in each folder.  This should build the service
   in that folder and update both go.mod and go.sum.
5. Update git with both go.mod and go.sum files and be sure these are
   pushed to github.
6. Tag changes after you push them to github, if you are planning to 
   build Docker containers with what is in github.  Run git tag -v0.3.#,
   incrementing #.  Also, be sure to push the new tag to github: 
   git push origin v0.3.#.
7. Look at any of the Docker containers I have created for examples of
   how to build these components in a new installation.  It is actually
   pretty easy.  However, for services that use protobuf, DO NOT forget
   to copy in the proto/ folder into the container before trying to build.

I think the above are the major things to be careful about when using 
go modules and building services in docker containers using go mod.

I also am using docker-compose.  This is working, but there are some 
things to watch out for.  To launch all the services, just run
docker-compose up.  However, some of the services may fail to launch
because of the order the services start.  Run docker ps to check that
all the servers are running.  For any that are not running, just run
docker-compose up <service-name>.

I can stop all the services with docker-compose down.

I can also build any given service with docker-compose build <service-name>.

If I issue docker-compose up, it will also build any containers that need to
be rebuilt before launching those services.  I can append --no-cache if I want
to force it to rebuild from scratch rather than relying on cached build steps.

As of right now, Jan 2, 2020, I have everything working correctly through 
Tutorial 3.  That means I have correctly running mongodb, postgres,
consignment-server, vessel-server and user-server services.  And, both the
consignment-cli and the user-cli correctly connect and do what they do.
Woo hoo!  It has been a solid week trying to get this all working with the 
addition of the user client and server.

I want to add that I also solved a problem in the cli.go user-client file
where it could not find github.com/micro/go-micro/cmd.  I had to hunt through
that repository on github and discovered that they moved the cmd code into the 
config folder when they updated with the v1.8.0 tag. It turns out that all they
did was move the cmd folder into the codec folder.  That meant I just changed
the import statement to "github.com/micro/go-micro/config/cmd" and everything
built and worked correctly.

Things I've learned about in this series:

- golang syntax and usage
- go modules
- microservices using grpg and go-micro
- docker image construction and usage
- docker networking
- docker-compose
- setting up microservices as events (pub/sub)
- authenticating services
- json vs. 
- read and write to mongodb and postgres
- HTTP 2 binary messages
- 

Things still to do:
- Google Cloud
- Kubernetes
- web interfaces

*** micro api, rpc, etc lesson learned ***
Using micro to respond to http requests by mapping them to microservices on the backend has been challenging.
The documentation is not as good as it needs to be and I think, in some cases, it is just wrong (or out of date).
In particular, calls using `http://localhost:8080/rpc` don't work no matter what I've tried.  And, the example
code provided by the developers of micro don't even use that call form when the handler for micro api is rpc.
They use a web URL form like this:  http://localhost:8080/auth/create.

Now this is not conclusive as I am still trying to make all this work reliably.  And by that, I mean, that I
understand it well enough to make it work as needed.

One important thing I have determined is that, when running micro api, it needs to be on the same network, or 
have network access to, the network where the microservices are running.  I've been running all the shippy 
services on the "host" network when running things in docker.  When doing that, I also need to run micro on
that network.  Otherwise, it will only see the http request, but not be able to route it to the microservices
running on "host".  So, to start micro correctly, I need to issue this command:

`docker run --net="host" -p 8080:8080 -e MICRO_REGISTRY=mdns microhq/micro --handler=rpc --address=:8080 --namespace=shippy`

When running as above, I can call, for example, against the user service (Auth) like this to Create a user:

```
curl -XPOST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-d '{"name": "Rich James", "company": "XYZ", "email": "rsj@gmail.com", "password": "testing123"}' \
	http://localhost:8080/auth/create
```

What I am unclear about is how micro upper-cases my lowercase elements in that URI.  I know it maps the 
above call to the service, shippy.auth, and calls the method, Auth.Create.  But if I've defined a method
called, Auth.GetUser, I don't know if a call to `http://localhost:8080/auth/getuser` will correctly map
to that method.
